# Testing of various incremental task graph construction approaches

## What this project is NOT

It is never meant to be readily usable, by itself or by any other project.

To keep things simple, there is no real computation workload implemented (e.g. OpenCV).

There is no mutex protection, since the simulations will run single-threaded.

No cross-thread exception handling, since threading isn't involved.
